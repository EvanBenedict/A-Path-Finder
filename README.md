# A-Path-Finder
An attempt at visual representing the A* path finding algorithm.
Although it is relatively efficient, it may not always find the best path.


Notes
  Start and end points are currently set through coordinates entered into dialogue boxes
  Obstacles must be added to the list of obstacle nodes manually in the PathApp class
  grid size and visualization speed can be changed manually in PathApp.java as well
